This is a do-you-know-me quiz created using javascript.

In this code I used a method called ReadlineSync, it is used to take input from the user in a CLI app.

Afterwards, I created an array of objects of questions along with the correct answers to it.

I ran a for loop on this array which display a new question in each iteration and if the user inputs
the correct answer it will increment the score by 1 and if not then it will the score as it is.

At the end, the score is displayed.
